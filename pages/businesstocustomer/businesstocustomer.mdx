## Business to Customer Payment

The `business2Customer` method in the `MpesaPay` class allows businesses to initiate payments from their M-Pesa business accounts to individual customers' M-Pesa accounts. This functionality is commonly used for services such as salary disbursements, refunds, or any other business-to-customer payment scenarios.

### Initiating a Business to Customer Payment

To initiate a business to customer payment, follow these steps:

1. Import the `MpesaPay` class from the `mpesapay` module:

```javascript
import MpesaPay from 'mpesapay';
```

2. Create an instance of the `MpesaPay` class with your M-Pesa API credentials:

```javascript
const Consumer_Key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY';
const Consumer_Secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
const Business_Short_Code = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE';
const Passkey = 'YOUR_PASS_KEY';
const Transaction_Description = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION';
const Account_Reference = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE';
const PartyA = 'YOUR_MPESA_PARTYA';
const B2C_Security_Credential = 'YOUR_MPESA_B2C_SECURITY_CREDENTIAL';
const Initiator_Name = 'YOUR_MPESA_INITIATORS_NAME';
const Environment = 'sandbox';

const mpesapay = new MpesaPay(
  Consumer_Key,
  Consumer_Secret,
  Business_Short_Code,
  Passkey,
  Account_Reference,
  Transaction_Description,
  PartyA,
  B2C_Security_Credential,
  Initiator_Name,
  Environment
);
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual M-Pesa API credentials.

3. Call the `business2Customer` method to initiate the payment:

```javascript
async function initiateBusinessToCustomerPayment(amount, phoneNumber, transactionDescription, callbackUrl) {
  try {
    const results = await mpesapay.business2Customer(amount, phoneNumber, transactionDescription, callbackUrl);
    console.log(results);
    // Handle the response data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors
  }
}

// Call the function to initiate the business to customer payment
const amount = 10; // The payment amount in Kenyan shillings
const phoneNumber = '254708374149'; // The customer's phone number
const transactionDescription = 'Payment Done'; // A description of the payment
const callbackUrl = 'https://example.com/callback'; // The URL to receive payment status updates
initiateBusinessToCustomerPayment(amount, phoneNumber, transactionDescription, callbackUrl);
```

Here is an explanation of the parameters for the `business2Customer` method:

- `amount`: The amount of money to be paid. This should be a numerical value representing the payment amount in Kenyan shillings.
- `phoneNumber`: The phone number of the customer receiving the payment. This should be a string value starting with the country code (e.g., "254" for Kenya), followed by the phone number without any spaces or special characters.
- `transactionDescription`: A description or reference for the payment transaction. This should be a string value.
- `callbackUrl`: The URL that M-Pesa will use to send payment status updates to your server. This should be a string value containing a valid URL.

The `business2Customer` method initiates the payment process and returns a Promise. The Promise resolves with the payment results if the payment was successfully initiated, or rejects with an error if the payment initiation fails.

> Please note that ```business2Customer``` function only initiates the payments, and the results will be sent to the provided callback URL. Make sure to implement the necessary server-side logic to handle the business to customer payment confirmation notifications and update your database accordingly.

Make sure to handle the response data and errors accordingly in your application.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the correct phone number, transaction description, and callback URL to process the business to customer payment. The callback URL should be a valid and accessible endpoint on your server to receive payment status updates from M-Pesa.
