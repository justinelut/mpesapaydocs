## Receiving Payment Confirmation on Server

After initiating the payment using MpesaPay's `stkPush` method, M-Pesa will send the payment confirmation to the `callbackUrl` you specified during the payment initiation. The confirmation is sent in the form of a POST request to your server's endpoint. To handle this incoming payment confirmation on your server, you can set up a route or API endpoint to receive the data.

### Payment Statuses

The `FormatPaymentData` helper method from the `mpesapay` module formats the Mpesa payment details and provides the following payment statuses:

- **Success**: The payment was successfully processed and completed.
- **Canceled**: The payment was canceled by the user or terminated for some reason.
- **Failed**: The payment failed due to an error or insufficient funds.

### Backend Setup

To create the Node.js backend and handle the payment confirmation, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express mpesapay
```

2. Create a new JavaScript file, such as `server.js`, as the entry point for your backend code.

3. Import the necessary dependencies and initialize the Express app:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import { FormatPaymentData } from 'mpesapay';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

### Handle Payment Confirmation Endpoint

To handle the payment confirmation endpoint, add the following code:

```javascript
app.post('/callback', (req, res) => {
  const paymentData = req.body;

  // Format the payment data using the FormatPaymentData helper method
  const { status, resultCode, message, data: paymentdata } = FormatPaymentData(paymentData);

  // Process the payment based on the status
  if (status === 'success') {
    // Save the payment data to the database
    // Replace the code below with your actual database logic
    // Example using MongoDB and Mongoose
    const Payment = require('./models/payment'); // Import your Payment model
    const newPayment = new Payment(paymentdata);
    newPayment.save()
      .then((savedPayment) => {
        console.log('Payment data saved:', savedPayment);
        res.sendStatus(200);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error saving payment data:', error);
        res.sendStatus(500);
      });
  } else if (status === 'canceled') {
    console.log('Payment canceled:', message);
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } else if (status === 'failed') {
    console.log('Payment failed:', message);
    res.sendStatus(200);
  } else {
    console.log('Invalid payment status');
    res.sendStatus(400);
  }
});
```

In this code snippet, we define an endpoint `/callback` that handles the incoming payment confirmation POST request. The payment data is extracted from the request body.

#### FormatPaymentData Helper Method

Before processing the payment based on its status, we use the `FormatPaymentData` helper method to format the payment details. This method ensures that the data received from M-Pesa is properly structured and provides easy access to relevant information.

Here's an example of how to use the `FormatPaymentData` helper method:

```javascript
import { FormatPaymentData } from 'mpesapay';

// ...

app.post('/callback', (req, res) => {
  const paymentData = req.body;

  // Format the payment data using the FormatPaymentData helper method
  const { status, resultCode, message, data: paymentdata } = FormatPaymentData(paymentData);

  // ...
});
```

The `FormatPaymentData` helper method takes the `paymentData` object received from M-Pesa and returns an object with the following properties:

- `status`: The status of the payment (`'success'`, `'canceled'`, or `'failed'`).
- `resultCode`: The result code provided by M-Pesa.
- `message`: A descriptive message associated with the payment status.
- `data`: The formatted payment data with relevant information.

Using the destructuring assignment syntax, we extract these properties from the result of the `FormatPaymentData` method and assign them to variables for further processing.

### Start the Server

Finally, start the server by adding the following code at the end of the `server.js` file:

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Node.js backend to handle the Mpesa payment confirmation on your server. The payment confirmation data is received via the `/callback` endpoint, formatted using the `FormatPaymentData` helper method, and can be further processed or saved to a database based on your application's requirements.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific database setup and error handling. Ensure that you implement appropriate security measures and validate the incoming data to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the payment confirmation.

Feel free to modify the code to fit your application's needs and explore further integration possibilities with the `mpesapay` module.
