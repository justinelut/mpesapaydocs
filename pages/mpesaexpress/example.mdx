## Example

Here is a complete example implementation:

```javascript
import MpesaPay from 'mpesapay';
```

Create an instance of the `MpesaPay` class with your Mpesa API credentials:

```javascript
const Consumer_Key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY';
const Consumer_Secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
const Business_Short_Code = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE';
const Passkey = 'YOUR_PASS_KEY';
const Transaction_Description = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION';
const Account_Reference = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE';
const PartyA = "YOUR_MPESA_PARTYA"
const B2C_Security_Credential = "YOUR MPESA B2C SECURITY CREDENTIAL"
const Initiator_Name = "YOUR MPESA INITIATORS NAME"
const Environment = 'sandbox'



const mpesapay = new MpesaPay(
  Consumer_Key,
  Consumer_Secret,
  Business_Short_Code,
  Passkey,
  Account_Reference,
  Transaction_Description,
  PartyA,
  B2C_Security_Credential,
  Initiator_Name,
  Environment
);
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Mpesa credentials and customize the handling of the response data and errors according to your application's requirements.


## TypeScript Support

The Mpesa Pay module includes TypeScript type definitions, providing enhanced development experience and type checking capabilities when using the library in a TypeScript project.


That's it! You can now integrate Mpesa payments into your Node.js application using the Mpesa Pay library.

> Please note that ```stkPush``` only initiates payments, and the results will be sent to the provided callback URL. Make sure to implement the necessary server-side logic to handle the payment confirmation notifications and update your database accordingly.
