## Stkpush Transaction Status

The `stkPushQuery` method in the `MpesaPay` class allows you to retrieve the status of a previously initiated [STK Push](/mpesaexpress/stkpush) transaction. You can use this method to check whether a payment transaction was successful or canceled by the user.

### Checking Transaction Status of the stkpush method

To check the status of a previously initiated STK push transaction, follow these steps:

1. Import the `MpesaPay` class from the `mpesapay` module:

```javascript
import MpesaPay from 'mpesapay';
```

2. Create an instance of the `MpesaPay` class with your M-Pesa API credentials:

```javascript
const Consumer_Key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY';
const Consumer_Secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
const Business_Short_Code = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE';
const Passkey = 'YOUR_PASS_KEY';
const Transaction_Description = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION';
const Account_Reference = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE';
const PartyA = "YOUR_MPESA_PARTYA"
const B2C_Security_Credential = "YOUR MPESA B2C SECURITY CREDENTIAL"
const Initiator_Name = "YOUR MPESA INITIATORS NAME"
const Environment = 'THE ENVIRONMENT i.e sandbox or live'
const Transaction_Type = "YOUR SHORTCODE TYPE i.e paybill or till"



const mpesapay = new MpesaPay(
  Consumer_Key,
  Consumer_Secret,
  Business_Short_Code,
  Passkey,
  Account_Reference,
  Transaction_Description,
  PartyA,
  B2C_Security_Credential,
  Initiator_Name,
  Environment
  Transaction_Type
);
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual M-Pesa API credentials.

3. Call the `stkPushQuery` method to check the transaction status:

```javascript
async function checkTransactionStatus(checkoutRequestID) {
  try {
    const response = await mpesapay.stkPushQuery(checkoutRequestID);
    console.log(response);
    // Handle the response data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors
  }
}

// Call the function to check the transaction status
const checkoutRequestID = 'YOUR_CHECKOUT_REQUEST_ID';
checkTransactionStatus(checkoutRequestID);
```

Here is an explanation of the parameter for the `stkPushQuery` method:

- `checkoutRequestID`: The unique identifier of the STK push transaction you want to check. This should be a string value representing the `CheckoutRequestID` returned when the payment was requested.

> Please refer to [STK Push](/mpesaexpress/stkpush) for a complete example of how to initiate payment and how to obtain the `CheckoutRequestID`

The `stkPushQuery` method initiates a request to retrieve the status of the transaction associated with the provided `CheckoutRequestID`. It returns a Promise. The Promise resolves with the response data if the status retrieval was successful, or rejects with an error if the retrieval fails.

Please handle the response data and errors appropriately in your application.

The response returned after calling the `stkPushQuery` method with the `CheckoutRequestID` will either be:

#### Successful transaction

```json
{
  "ResponseCode": "0",
  "ResponseDescription": "The service request has been accepted successfully",
  "MerchantRequestID": "23308-183815995-1",
  "CheckoutRequestID": "ws_CO_16072023200432073740455200",
  "ResultCode": "0",
  "ResultDesc": "The service request is processed successfully."
}
```

or

#### Canceled or Failed Transaction

```json
{
  "ResponseCode": "0",
  "ResponseDescription": "The service request has been accepted successfully",
  "MerchantRequestID": "36055-24147609-1",
  "CheckoutRequestID": "ws_CO_16072023200548820740455200",
  "ResultCode": "1032",
  "ResultDesc": "Request canceled by user"
}
```

> From the returned information, you are therefore able to confirm the payment status and return a response to the user who initiated the payment,

Ensure that you have the correct `CheckoutRequestID` to retrieve the transaction status, [stkPush ](/mpesaexpress/stkpush#response-object)
