## Transaction Status

The `transactionStatus` method in the `MpesaPay` class allows you to retrieve the status of a previously initiated payment transaction. You can use this method to check whether a payment transaction was successful, failed, or is still being processed.

### Checking Transaction Status

To check the status of a previously initiated payment transaction, follow these steps:

1. Import the `MpesaPay` class from the `mpesapay` module:

```javascript
import MpesaPay from 'mpesapay';
```

2. Create an instance of the `MpesaPay` class with your M-Pesa API credentials:

```javascript
const Consumer_Key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY';
const Consumer_Secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET';
const Business_Short_Code = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_SHORT_CODE';
const Passkey = 'YOUR_PASS_KEY';
const Transaction_Description = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION';
const Account_Reference = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_REFERENCE';
const PartyA = 'YOUR_MPESA_PARTYA';
const B2C_Security_Credential = 'YOUR_MPESA_B2C_SECURITY_CREDENTIAL';
const Initiator_Name = 'YOUR_MPESA_INITIATORS_NAME';
const Environment = 'sandbox | live';

const mpesapay = new MpesaPay(
  Consumer_Key,
  Consumer_Secret,
  Business_Short_Code,
  Passkey,
  Account_Reference,
  Transaction_Description,
  PartyA,
  B2C_Security_Credential,
  Initiator_Name,
  Environment
);
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual M-Pesa API credentials.

3. Call the `transactionStatus` method to check the transaction status:

```javascript
async function checkTransactionStatus(transactionId, callbackUrl) {
  try {
    const response = await mpesapay.transactionStatus(transactionId, callbackUrl);
    console.log(response);
    // Handle the response data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // Handle errors
  }
}

// Call the function to check the transaction status
const transactionId = 'YOUR_TRANSACTION_ID';
const callbackUrl = 'https://example.com/callback';
checkTransactionStatus(transactionId, callbackUrl);
```

Here is an explanation of the parameters for the `transactionStatus` method:

- `transactionId`: The unique identifier of the transaction you want to check. This should be a string value representing the transaction ID returned when the payment was initiated.
- `callbackUrl`: The URL that M-Pesa will use to send the transaction status details to your server. This should be a string value containing a valid URL.

The `transactionStatus` method initiates a request to retrieve the status of the transaction and returns a Promise. The Promise resolves with the response data if the status retrieval was successful, or rejects with an error if the retrieval fails.

> Please note that Mpesa Pay only initiates transaction status, and the results will be sent to the provided callback URL. Make sure to implement the necessary server-side logic to handle the transaction status confirmation notifications and update your database accordingly.

Make sure to handle the response data and errors accordingly in your application.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the correct transaction ID and callback URL to receive the transaction status information from M-Pesa. The callback URL should be a valid and accessible endpoint on your server.
