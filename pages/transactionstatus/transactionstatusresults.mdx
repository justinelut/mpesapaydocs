## Receiving Transaction Status Results on Server

After retrieving the transaction status results using the `await mpesapay.transactionStatus('transactionid', 'callbackurl')` method, you can format and process the data according to your requirements. The transaction status data does not require a specific helper method, as you can format it on your own based on the structure of the response. You can then save the formatted data to the database or perform any other necessary actions.

### Backend Setup

To create the Node.js backend and handle the transaction status results, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install express
```

2. Create a new JavaScript file, such as `server.js`, as the entry point for your backend code.

3. Import the necessary dependencies and initialize the Express app:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

### Handle Transaction Status Results Endpoint

To handle the transaction status results endpoint, add the following code:

```javascript
app.post('/callback', (req, res) => {
  const transactionStatusData = req.body;

  // Format and process the transaction status data according to your requirements
  const formattedData = formatTransactionStatusData(transactionStatusData);

  // Save the formatted data to the database or perform any other necessary actions
  saveTransactionStatusDataToDatabase(formattedData)
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Transaction status data saved to the database.');
      res.sendStatus(200);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error saving transaction status data:', error);
      res.sendStatus(500);
    });
});
```

In this code snippet, we define an endpoint `/callback` that handles the incoming transaction status results POST request. The transaction status data is extracted from the request body.

### Format and Process Transaction Status Data

The `formatTransactionStatusData` function is a placeholder for your own formatting and processing logic. You can define this function to structure the transaction status data according to your database schema or application requirements.

Here's an example of how you can structure and process the transaction status data:

```javascript
function formatTransactionStatusData(transactionStatusData) {
  // Perform formatting and processing of the transaction status data
  // Replace this code with your own logic

  const formattedData = {
    transactionId: transactionStatusData.transactionId,
    status: transactionStatusData.status,
    resultCode: transactionStatusData.resultCode,
    // Additional properties as needed
  };

  return formattedData;
}
```

The `formatTransactionStatusData` function takes the `transactionStatusData` object received from M-Pesa and structures it into a desired format. You can extract relevant properties from the response object and assign them to variables or create a new object with the required data.

### Save Transaction Status Data to the Database

The `saveTransactionStatusDataToDatabase` function represents the step where you save the formatted transaction status data to your database. You can replace this function with your own database logic, using an ORM or database library of your choice.

Here's an example using MongoDB and Mongoose:

```javascript
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

// Define your database schema
const transactionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  transactionId: String,
  status: String,
  resultCode: String,
  // Additional schema fields as needed
});

// Create a Mongoose model based on the schema
const Transaction = mongoose.model('Transaction', transactionSchema);

// Save the transaction status data to the database
async function saveTransactionStatusDataToDatabase(data) {
  try {
    const transaction = new Transaction(data);
    await transaction.save();
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Error saving transaction status data to the database');
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a MongoDB schema for the transaction data and create a Mongoose model based on the schema. The `saveTransactionStatusDataToDatabase` function creates a new transaction instance and saves it to the database using the Mongoose `save` method. If an error occurs during the save operation, an error is thrown.

### Start the Server

Finally, start the server by adding the following code at the end of the `server.js` file:

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Node.js backend to handle the transaction status results on your server. The transaction status data is received via the `/callback` endpoint, formatted according to your requirements, and can be further processed or saved to a database based on your application's needs.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific database setup and error handling. Ensure that you implement appropriate security measures and validate the incoming data to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the transaction status results.

Feel free to modify the code to fit your application's needs and explore further integration possibilities with other modules or libraries.
